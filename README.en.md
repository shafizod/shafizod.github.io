## General principles of the protocol

The interaction between the Agent (hereinafter referred to as the Partner) and the System (hereinafter Alif) is built on the basis of the HTTPS protocol (RFC 2818: HTTP/1.1) in the "request-response" mode, where the initiator of the request is always the Partner, and the responder is Alif. All requests must be sent with the POST method.

Each Affiliate payment has a unique identifier, which is transmitted in each request. According to the Partner's identifier, further reconciliation of mutual settlements and resolution of disputes is carried out.

When processing a request from the Partner, Alif performs the required operation, and then sends the data and the result of the operation to the Partner as a response.

## Protocol organization

The interaction between the Partner and Alif is as follows:

1. The partner generates a request in JSON format, including the necessary data, and sends it via HTTPS to Alif at https://alifpay.tj/gate/check to check the client's account and create a payment. Alif performs client authorization and JSON parsing. In case of successful authorization, Alif performs the necessary actions and returns to the Partner a response in JSON format, including the result of the request. If the Affiliate receives a successful response ("code":200, "status":"accepted"), he may proceed to the next step (2).

2. After receiving a successful response from the Check request, you must confirm the payment by sending a request to https://alifpay.tj/gate/pay. Affiliate will proceed to the next step (3) if they receive a non-final response ("statusCode":2)

3. Upon receipt of a non-final response from the Pay request, it is necessary to send a Payment Status Check request to https://alifpay.tj/gate/post_check with an interval of 5 minutes.

4. If the Partner repeats paragraph (1) with the same data, he will receive the answer: "code":409, "status":"{payment status in Alif}". After receiving such a response, you can proceed to the next step (2) only if the payment status in Alif is "accepted".

5. If the Partner repeats paragraph (2) with the same data, he will receive a response: "code":406, "status":"{payment status in the Alifa System}". After receiving such a response, if the payment status is not final (final statuses: success, failed, canceled), go to step (3).

6. In addition to these requests, there is also an optional request to Verify the beneficiary's account at https://alifpay.tj/gate/accounts. Upon receipt of the accounts request, Alif will check for the specified service the presence of a subscriber with the specified identifier. The success indicator for this request is "code":200.

## Safety

1. The interface must accept requests from the Partner's IP addresses, which were previously transferred to Alif's technical staff.

2. userid and password - Partner's user ID and password. Are generated and transferred privately to the Partner by Alif. For the purposes of this documentation, the following data is used: userid="476a1b42-b3dc-40e9-afad-4aaae1d640b9", password="cztef62wrwcysyubbbdnhlk1rs2cztfsqgwww7j0".

3. Requests use an Authentication token (hash), which is essentially the signature of the request. This hash will be used in all requests as part of the authentication process and consists of a hashed string resulting from the application of the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm. The parameters of the algorithm are the String and password of the Partner's user.

4. The time limit for hash generation consists of the concatenation of certain fields and differs in different queries. In the explanation of the parameters of each request, the formula for concatenating this String is given.
